# Tutorials

These tutorials cover the basics of creating messaging applications using AMQP/RabbitMQ with kourier.

To follow these tutorials, we recommend having a RabbitMQ server running locally or in a Docker container. You can find
instructions on how to set up RabbitMQ in the [RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/download).
